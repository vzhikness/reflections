How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped to find a bug very quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It lets me remind something I forgot or did wrong. It allows me to find
    bugs faster. It allows me to restore someting accidently deleted.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you manually separate developing in logical parts, easy to track
    history.
    Cons: more manual work, possibility to forget to commit anything.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when you develop something, you often have to edit multiple files.
    And later it's easier to track changes to the whole project. Google Docs is
    intended to work with a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" shows history of commits in descending order.
    "git diff id-1 id-2" shows differencies between these two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now I can track history of changes to try to find the bug. When found
    a commit without a bug I can diff two adjacent commits and see
    what chenged. Cool!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm going to use git for my html/css portfolio and upload it to github.
