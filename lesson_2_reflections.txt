What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    The metadata of the git project is created. It is stored in
    the directory .git. I need it to keep track of file versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The files only needed for tracking are put to staging dir. These are being prepared to commit. This help us to include only needed files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

    You can edit multiple files at once. But you can add to staging area
    only those files that are going to be committed. Also it's easy to
    track differences between those.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    When you want to make some changes in code which should not impact the main
    project line. E.g. you want to add a new feature, but it isn't intended to
    be in main project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Now it's easier to understand how branching works. It helped much.
