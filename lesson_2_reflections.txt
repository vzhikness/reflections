What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    The metadata of the git project is created. It is stored in
    the directory .git. I need it to keep track of file versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The files only needed for tracking are put to staging dir. These are being prepared to commit. This help us to include only needed files.
