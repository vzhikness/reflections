When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  If you want to share your work with other people or if you work 
  at two computers then it would be cool to keep a copy of your
  project on remote server.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because I don't always need all the updates from the remote. If it would
  automatically, then it may cause problems conflict with existing. So it is
  better to have control over it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

  Branch is another story of commits which starts from one point in master's
  branch. Clone is a copy of a repository, it contains all files and history.
  Fork is just a feature of GitHub, it's almost clone but done by GitHub
  for you on their servers. Also it saves number of forking and leave
  reference in a forked repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  It's good for comparing the states of remote and local repos. It also might
  help to show conflicts between local and remote versions.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  I guess we might be using emails and tracking it manually. It would be easier
  to add changes to the repository but harder to track and manage them.
