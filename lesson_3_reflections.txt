When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  If you want to share your work with other people or if you work 
  at two computers then it would be cool to keep a copy of your
  project on remote server.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because I don't always need all the updates from the remote. If it would
  automatically, then it may cause problems conflict with existing. So it is
  better to have control over it.
